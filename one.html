      <p>On the topic of culture,&nbsp Nepal has been a country that has been influenced heavily by many beliefs due to

        Buddhism and Hinduism,&nbsp which have coexisted in the country for hundreds of years.&nbsp For a general overview of
        the geogrpahy,&nbsp Nepal is split into 3 main regions,&nbsp the Himalaya(to the north),&nbsp Hills(middle region) and
        terai(to the south).&nbsp All these regions combine to be home to around 101 ethnic groups
        in Nepal and over  92 languages spoken in the country.</p>

        <h3>Boudhanath Stupa</h3>
        <p>
          Boudhanath Stupa is an historic stupa located in Kathmandu. The stupa is believed to have been built around<br>
          the 14th century.<br> <br>
          It has a massive semicircle dome, with the towering spire that has eyes of all 4 sides to represent the all-<br> knowing nature of the Buddha.
          The overall shape also represents a Buddhist mandala, and expresses the path<br>  towards enlightenment.<br> <br>

          Historically, its location is an ancient trade route that spans from Tibet to Kathmandu. The area is also home<br>
           to a majority of Tibetan who settled in that area for refuge after China’s invasion of Tibet.<br> <br>
            The Boudhanath Stupa suffered greatly during the 2015 earthquake of Nepal, but was eventually preserved <br> back to its normal state.<br>

      <p>
        The world has 195 countries around the world,&nbsp each with its own story,&nbsp this website<br>
         plans to expose 1 of them.&nbsp When you ask most people what they know about Nepal,<br>
         many recall Mt.Everest or where Dr.Strange was filmed.&nbsp Although those things may<br>
         be true, there is still a lot more that is left uncharted in this nation, &nbsp yet to<br>
          be explored.<br>
     </p>
      <p>
        With Nepal being a small nation,&nbsp it has not had the most representation in the western <br>
        world. When thinking of countries to explore, &nbsp Nepal doesn't quite come up in many <br>
        people's lists either.&nbsp Nepal,hidden amidst the mountainous regions of the Himalayas,<br>
        &nbsp is a gem that is awaiting to be explored.A country that will change yourperspective <br>
        on life,&nbsp through its vibrant culture and natural riches.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nepal is a country that is located in Asia.&nbsp It is a landlocked nation of around 28<br>
        million  people sandwiched between Indian and China. It is a country known for its <br>
        natural beauty and spiritual locations.
      </p>
      <p>Through this website,&nbsp I hope to expose the beauty,&nbsp culture and history of Nepal and <br>
        why it should be on your list of countries to visit soon!&nbsp The webiste is divied into 3 <br>
        main sections,&nbsp Culture,&nbsp Food and Destinations,&nbsp each being an important aspect <br>
        of Nepal</p>
